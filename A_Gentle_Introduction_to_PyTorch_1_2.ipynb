        "- `nn.Linear(...)` defines the dense layer and it requires the `in` and `out` dimensions, which corresponds to the size of the input feature and output feature of that layer, respectively. \n",
        "- `nn.Dropout(...)` is used to define a dropout layer. Dropout is an approach in deep learning that helps a model to avoid overfitting. This means that dropout acts as a regularization technique that helps the model to not overfit on the images it has seen while training. We want this because we need a model that generalizes well to unseen examples -- in our case, the testing dataset. Dropout randomly zeroes some of the units of the neural network layer with probability of `p=0.2`. Read more about the dropout layer [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dropout). \n",

        "    - then we feed the batches of those 1D images into the first hidden layer\n",
        "    - the output of that hidden layer is then applied a [non-linear activate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) called `ReLU`. It's not so important to know what `F.relu()` does at the moment, but the effect that it achieves is that it allows faster and more effective training of neural architectures on large datasets\n",
        "    - as explained above, the dropout also helps the model to train more efficiently by avoiding overfitting on the training data\n",
        "    - we then feed the output of that dropout layer into the output layer (`d2`)\n",
        "    - the result of that is then fed to the [softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function), which converts or normalized the output into a probability distribution which helps with outputting proper predictions values that are used to calculate the accuracy of the model; this will the final output of the model"
